00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
E3-The NavalTreaty

00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:11.572
There's nobody there,
there's nobody there!

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:15.951
Help me, help me,
help me, help me!

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.452
There's nobody there!

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:18.912
There's nobody there!

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:20.789
There's nobody there!

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:29.423
Help me, help me,
help me, help, help!

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:35.220
Treachery, ruined, ruined,
[inaudible] England!

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:23.101
Holmes, Holmes?

00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:26.813
Holmes?

00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:32.694
Holmes, Holmes?

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.822
You come as a crisis,
Watson!

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.001
Help yourself to tobacco
from the Persian slipper.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.796
I shall be at your service
in an instant.

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:10.983
If this remains blue,
all is well.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:15.696
If it turns red,
it's a man's life.

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:20.868
I thought as much.

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.953
Mrs. Hudson!

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.582
Mrs. Hudson!

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:32.379
Would you find Billy,
please,

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.591
and tell him to dispatch
these telegrams without delay.

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:36.508
Thank you.

00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:40.345
Oh, Sit down, Watson.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.854
A commonplace
little murder!

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:52.608
You have something
more interesting, I fancy.

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.943
You are the stormy petrel
of crime, Watson.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.112
What is it?

00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:00.157
I've had a letter from a boy
I was at school with.

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:03.535
I think you
should read it.

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.954
Percy Phelps,
brilliant boy,

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.956
carried off every prize
the school had to offer,

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.375
went on to fresh
triumphs at Cambridge.

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.168
I must confess,

00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:15.297
he'd passed completely
out of my mind until this.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.465
"My Dear Watson:

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.092
I have no doubt you remember
Tadpole Phelps,

00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:22.304
who was in the third form
when you were in the fifth.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.014
It's possible
you may have heard

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.933
that through
my uncle's influence

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:28.894
I obtained a good appointment
at the Foreign Office."

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:31.647
His uncle's Lord Holdhurst.

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:33.899
"And that I was in a position
of trust and honor

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:38.111
till a horrible misfortune came
suddenly to blast my career."

00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:41.740
Yes, his gaudy connections
did him little good at school.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.200
It seemed to us
a piquant thing

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:45.911
to chevy him about
the playground,

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:50.457
hit him over
the shins with a wicket.

00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:52.167
"Do you think you could bring
your friend Mr. Holmes

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.795
down to see me?"

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.338
That doesn't tell us much.

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.548
Hardly anything.

00:04:57.673 --> 00:05:00.717
But the writing is of interest,
it is a woman's.

00:05:00.843 --> 00:05:02.261
No, no,
a man's, surely.

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.847
No, a woman's.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.851
At the commencement of a case
it is always something to know

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:12.271
that a client is in
close contact with someone who,

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:17.818
for good or evil,
has an exceptional nature.

00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:20.153
You're interested?

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:24.324
Indeed.

00:05:24.408 --> 00:05:25.158
Well, if you are ready,

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:29.121
let us start for
Briarbrae House Woking, at once.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:30.414
Well, my practice--

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.207
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.376
Well, I mean, if your cases
are more interesting than mine.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.169
I was gonna say,

00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:38.213
my practice would do very well
for a day or two.

00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:40.340
It's the slackest time
of the year.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:43.177
Excellent.

00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:45.304
Then let us visit
this diplomatist

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:47.347
who is in such evil case,

00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:51.560
and the lady to whom
he dictates his letters.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:55.063
Mrs. Hudson, hot water!

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.160
Ah, Rose.

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:11.330
Check this for me, would you?
That's a good love.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:16.877
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.921
And this is my colleague
and friend, Dr. Watson.

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:20.964
Dr. Watson,
I'm so glad you've come.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:24.927
Percy's been inquiring after you
all morning, poor chap.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:31.058
I perceive that you, yourself,
are not a member of the family?

00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:36.230
Of course,
you see my JH monogram.

00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:38.899
Now, for a moment I thought
you'd done something clever.

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.859
Joseph Harrison
is my name,

00:06:40.943 --> 00:06:43.278
and since Percy is betrothed
to my sister Annie,

00:06:43.362 --> 00:06:46.031
I shall at least be
a relation by marriage.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.242
You'll find her
in his room,

00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:52.371
she's been nursing him
these past two months.

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.581
Rose, in the house.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.970
Now, listen,
they're here.

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:09.263
Shall I leave?

00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:11.598
No, no.

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.823
My dear Watson,
I should never have known you

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:28.699
under that mustache,

00:07:28.824 --> 00:07:31.201
and I daresay you wouldn't
be prepared to swear to me.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:35.539
Not at all,
still the same dear old Tadpole.

00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:38.959
And this, I presume,
is your celebrated friend?

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:43.172
Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
Mr. Percy Phelps.

00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:45.090
And I'm Miss Harrison.

00:07:45.174 --> 00:07:47.342
My fianc , and my nurse.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.470
Please, sit down.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:57.853
I, uh, I showed Holmes
the letter that you wrote to me.

00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.229
Yes, I hoped you would.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:01.440
It was rather short on detail.

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.859
Then let me
get straight to the point.

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.986
I work as a clerk
in the Foreign Office.

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:08.614
My uncle
is Lord Holdhurst.

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:12.326
When he became Foreign Minister,
he gave me,

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.161
ocassional delicate
missions of trust,

00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:17.039
which I always managed
to conduct successfully.

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:19.666
I'm sure you did, old chap.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.753
Pray, continue, Mr. Phelps.

00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:24.213
Nearly ten weeks ago,

00:08:24.296 --> 00:08:26.381
it was the evening
of the 23rd of May,

00:08:26.507 --> 00:08:28.634
he called me
into his private room.

00:08:38.602 --> 00:08:42.189
Ah, Percy, my dear boy!

00:08:42.314 --> 00:08:43.941
Good evening, sir.

00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:46.944
You've heard
of the Naval Treaty

00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:51.114
that has just been drawn up
between England and ltaly?

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.824
I've read rumors
in the press, sir.

00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:54.910
Most regrettable,

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.912
and it is of
the utmost importance

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.747
that nothing further
should leak out.

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:00.999
The French
and Russian embassies

00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:05.379
would pay an immense sum
to learn its contents.

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.840
This is the original.

00:09:07.923 --> 00:09:09.800
It should
not leave my bureau

00:09:09.925 --> 00:09:13.011
were it not absolutely necessary
to have it copied.

00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:15.097
Take it straight to your office
and lock it up.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.726
Now, remain behind
when the others go,

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.061
so that you can work
at your leisure

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:24.231
and without fear
of being overlooked.

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:26.024
And when you have finished,

00:09:26.108 --> 00:09:30.654
relock both the original
and the draft in your own desk,

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:35.117
and hand them over to me
personally tomorrow morning.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.788
The very greatest care,
Nephew.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.623
You may rely on it, sir.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:42.958
This treaty,

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.961
can you be more precise
as to its nature?

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:48.589
Well, in outline it defined
the position of Great Britain

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:50.007
towards the Triple Alliance

00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:51.300
in the event
of the French fleet

00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:56.013
gaining complete ascendancy
over ltaly in the Mediterranean.

00:09:56.138 --> 00:09:57.472
I returned straight
to my office

00:09:57.598 --> 00:09:59.224
where I found
a colleague of mine,

00:09:59.308 --> 00:10:02.644
Mr. Charles Gorot,
still working.

00:10:02.728 --> 00:10:05.856
Well, chap,

00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:09.193
what did Uncle want?

00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:13.155
To congratulate me
on my engagement.

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:14.698
Splendid.

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:37.638
Nothing else?

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:41.308
Some fishing dispute
he wanted me to copy.

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:55.697
You're not still on that
Bulgarian piece, are you?

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:59.159
It's extremely long-winded
and tiresome,

00:10:59.243 --> 00:11:02.621
and I am fagged out
for the night.

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:06.041
You working late again?

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.835
Just a few things.

00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:10.045
You want to slack off a bit,
old man.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.589
Ambition is a fine thing
and all that,

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:16.134
but do not neglect
the beautiful Miss Harrison.

00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:19.555
Some other chap
might step in.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.973
She wouldn't have you, Charles.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:22.391
Well, not me, old man.

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:25.644
I've got my Daphne.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.187
Goodnight to you.

00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:29.273
Goodnight.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:43.954
You made sure that he was gone
before you started work?

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.456
Quite sure,
and I copied as fast as I could,

00:11:46.582 --> 00:11:49.501
for I knew that Joseph,
my fianc 's brother--

00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:52.004
We met him in the garden.

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:52.796
He was in town,

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:55.841
and was traveling back to Woking
by the 11:00 o'clock train.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:58.093
And I wanted to catch it,
if possible.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.721
But it was a long document?

00:12:00.846 --> 00:12:03.390
Written in French.

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:11.565
By 9:00 o'clock,
I was feeling drowsy

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:14.484
and scarcely a third
of the way through.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.820
I thought a cup of coffee
might clear my brain,

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.907
so I rang the commissioner
who stays on duty all night

00:12:20.032 --> 00:12:23.744
in a small lodge
at the bottom of the stairs.

00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:36.590
To my surprise, it was a woman
who answered the summons.

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:40.385
I'm sorry, I was ringing
for Mr. Tangey.

00:12:40.469 --> 00:12:41.595
I'm his wife, sir,

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.431
I do the char work
in this building.

00:12:44.515 --> 00:12:51.313
Ah, well, I was wondering if you
might bring me a cup of coffee.

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.482
I'll go and ask him, sir.

00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:56.610
This woman,

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:59.071
you've never noticed her
in the building before?

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:01.031
Never.

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:09.289
The coffee was some time coming,
so I went down to investigate.

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:12.209
Leaving the room unguarded?

00:13:13.502 --> 00:13:15.504
Yes.

00:13:18.507 --> 00:13:23.887
I found Tangey--asleep.

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:42.447
Mr. Phelps, sir,
I'm very sorry, sir.

00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:46.118
I must have just
dropped off for a moment.

00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:47.077
Your coffee, sir.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:54.960
Well, if you're here, sir,
who's ringing the bell?

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.962
Bell, what bell is it?

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:58.881
It's the bell in the room
in which you're working, sir.

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:05.971
You ran back upstairs

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:09.641
and the document was gone
from your desk.

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:12.311
Yes!

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:15.397
God no--

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.653
You passed
no one in the corridor?

00:14:21.737 --> 00:14:24.239
No one,
there was no one!

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:27.034
And the room
and the corridor

00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:29.828
all seemed exactly
as I'd left it!

00:14:29.912 --> 00:14:32.039
Percy has drawn a rough chart
of the building, Mr. Holmes,

00:14:32.164 --> 00:14:33.540
which he thought
might be of use.

00:14:33.624 --> 00:14:38.086
Yes, yes, that's of the utmost
importance, Mr. Holmes.

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:42.633
Yes, I think
I quite follow it.

00:14:42.758 --> 00:14:45.719
On your discovery of the theft,
what did you do then?

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.054
Well, I recognized
in an instant

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:50.432
the thief must have come up
through the side door.

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.142
This one here.

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:53.602
Yes, of course.
Well, you'd have met him

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:55.646
if he'd come the other way.

00:14:55.771 --> 00:14:58.023
And you are satisfied that they
could not have been concealed

00:14:58.106 --> 00:14:59.900
in the room
or in the corridor?

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:01.735
Absolutely impossible.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.403
All the other doors
were locked.

00:15:03.487 --> 00:15:07.241
Strict
Foreign Office regulations.

00:15:07.366 --> 00:15:09.284
There was no cover at all.

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:13.121
A rat couldn't have
concealed himself there.

00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:17.918
Tangey and I both rushed out

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:19.878
down the stairs that lead
into Charles Street.

00:15:19.962 --> 00:15:20.629
Mr. Phelps!

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:24.341
The door at
the bottom was closed, unlocked.

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:28.804
It was dark, raining.

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:32.558
There was no one!

00:15:32.641 --> 00:15:38.021
But I distinctly remember
the three-quarters of Big Ben.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:42.568
A quarter to ten.

00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:45.612
That is of
enormous importance.

00:15:45.696 --> 00:15:49.449
They came out here,
you see, Holmes.

00:15:49.533 --> 00:15:50.868
On the corner
we found a policeman,

00:15:50.993 --> 00:15:52.327
but he'd seen no one
leave the building

00:15:52.411 --> 00:15:53.287
in the last
quarter of an hour

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.955
except for
the Commissioner's wife,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.833
so we ran
through to Whitehall.

00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:03.380
It was full of traffic,
people coming and going,

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:05.507
all only too eager
to find a place of shelter

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:08.177
on so wet a night.

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:10.637
No lounger to tell you
who'd passed?

00:16:10.721 --> 00:16:11.972
None.

00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:14.725
Had it been raining
all evening?

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.351
Since about 7:00.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.353
Ah, this chain of events

00:16:18.437 --> 00:16:22.107
is certainly of
extraordinary interest.

00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:24.860
And so you returned
to the office,

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:26.528
examined it, I presume,

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:29.615
to see if the intruder
had left any traces;

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:34.578
muddy foot marks, any cigar end,
or dropped glove, hairpin?

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.872
There was nothing.

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:38.665
Except the tangible fact

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.001
that the Commissioner's wife
had run out of the building

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:44.796
not ten minutes earlier.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.633
What did you do next,
Mr. Phelps?

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:53.180
The constable
alerted Scotland Yard.

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:55.974
It was then
for the first time

00:16:56.058 --> 00:17:00.437
the full horror of
my situation came upon me.

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:04.066
I'd been so confident
of regaining the treaty,

00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:07.945
I dared not think--

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:08.904
Watson will tell you

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:12.699
I was a nervous,
sensitive boy at school.

00:17:12.783 --> 00:17:15.744
It's my nature.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:21.500
I thought of my uncle,
his cabinet colleagues,

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:28.674
the shame I'd brought
upon them, myself,

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:32.302
everyone connected with me.

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:35.764
Although I was the victim
of an accident,

00:17:35.848 --> 00:17:41.270
there are no allowance for
accidents in diplomatic circles.

00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:43.856
Ruined,

00:17:43.939 --> 00:17:49.278
shamefully,
hopelessly ruined!

00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:51.989
Steady on, old chap.

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:01.957
Stand back,
will you, Holmes.

00:18:23.604 --> 00:18:25.272
Is the investigation concluded?

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:30.485
Adjourned.

00:18:30.611 --> 00:18:33.906
Poor old Percy,
terrible strain, all this,

00:18:33.989 --> 00:18:36.575
career in the balance.

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.660
It seems not to have affected
your sister's devotion.

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.621
How long has she known
Mr. Phelps?

00:18:40.704 --> 00:18:43.415
Well, they met
in Northumberland in the winter.

00:18:43.499 --> 00:18:45.292
Percy was traveling
on government business

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:46.835
in that part
of the world.

00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:48.170
It was love
at first sight.

00:18:48.295 --> 00:18:50.297
Do your people approve
of the match?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.799
Indeed, Mr. Holmes,

00:18:52.883 --> 00:18:55.135
especially when they learned
of Percy's connection

00:18:55.219 --> 00:18:56.678
with Lord Holdhurst.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:58.680
My father is an iron-master,

00:18:58.764 --> 00:19:01.600
and a staunch supporter
of the Conservative Party.

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:03.352
She came down here
to meet Percy's people,

00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:04.436
and you came as escort?

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.187
That's right,

00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:07.564
just before they left
for America.

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:11.693
The, um, the wedding
is planned for September,

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.028
if the poor chap recovers.

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.030
I suppose you only intended
a short visit,

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:16.323
and then came the smash?

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:18.659
Mm.

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:24.665
May I ask you
what your occupation is

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.335
that allows you to while away
the summer in Woking?

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:30.045
As the eldest son,
Mr. Holmes,

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.507
I have expectations of
inheriting my father's business.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.009
I also dabble in
stocks and shares,

00:19:36.093 --> 00:19:39.513
which grants me
a certain independence.

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:43.016
My apologies if
my question offended you.

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:45.686
On the night
of May the 23rd,

00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:49.147
had you arranged to
meet Mr. Phelps at Waterloo

00:19:49.231 --> 00:19:50.899
to take the 11:00 o'clock
train together?

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.526
No.

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:54.069
That may have been
his intention,

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:56.780
he knew I was in London
dining with my stockbroker.

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.950
But I wasn't expecting
to meet him.

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:02.286
Then thank you for your time,
Mr. Harrison.

00:20:02.411 --> 00:20:08.876
Shall I, um,
and would you, the sick room.

00:20:15.424 --> 00:20:17.509
Mr. Holmes,
I do apologize.

00:20:17.593 --> 00:20:22.806
I feel calmer now, thanks to
Watson's ministration.

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:24.308
Gently with him, Holmes.

00:20:24.433 --> 00:20:26.560
Ah.

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:28.729
Mr. Phelps,

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:31.773
there is just the matter
of the Commissioner's wife.

00:20:31.899 --> 00:20:33.400
Yes, of course.

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:37.321
As I remember, shortly after
our return to my office,

00:20:37.446 --> 00:20:38.655
Inspector Forbes
of the Yard

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.618
arrived to take up the case
with considerable energy.

00:20:42.743 --> 00:20:44.912
We hired a hansom,
and within half an hour

00:20:45.037 --> 00:20:47.331
we were at the Tangeys' home
in Brixton.

00:20:47.456 --> 00:20:51.418
The door was opened
by his eldest daughter.

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:52.461
Hey, what do you want?

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:53.587
Is your mother at home?

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:54.796
Not yet.

00:20:54.922 --> 00:20:56.798
She does a night job--
cleaning.

00:20:56.924 --> 00:20:58.842
We'll wait for her,
if you don't mind.

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:01.845
In here.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.933
And you get back in here,
now go on, and shut the door.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.648
After about ten minutes,
we heard the front door,

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:14.775
and here we made
one serious mistake

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.403
for which I blame myself.

00:21:19.947 --> 00:21:22.783
Mum, there's two men in
the parlor wants to talk to ya'.

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:25.452
Oh, my God!

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.379
If it isn't Mr. Phelps
of the office.

00:21:35.504 --> 00:21:36.547
Come, come,
who did you think we were

00:21:36.672 --> 00:21:37.714
when you ran away from us?

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.466
I thought you was the bailiffs.

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:41.510
We've had some trouble
with a tradesman.

00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:47.391
Here, let go,
let go, let--

00:21:47.516 --> 00:21:48.058
We've reason to believe

00:21:48.183 --> 00:21:49.726
that you've taken a paper
of importance

00:21:49.852 --> 00:21:51.353
from the Foreign Office,

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:53.689
and you ran in here
to dispose of it.

00:21:53.814 --> 00:21:55.274
Now, you better come back
with us to Scotland Yard

00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:55.983
to be searched.

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:57.192
Get your hands off me!

00:21:57.317 --> 00:22:00.070
I didn't take no paper!
That will be enough--

00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:01.989
There will be peace and quiet.

00:22:02.114 --> 00:22:07.786
Mr. Phelps...no, stop it!

00:22:25.554 --> 00:22:28.390
You made a full examination
of the kitchen?

00:22:28.473 --> 00:22:29.975
Yes.

00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:33.228
There was no sign
of the documents.

00:22:35.063 --> 00:22:36.064
A four-wheeler was brought

00:22:36.148 --> 00:22:39.860
and we all three drove back
in it to Scotland Yard.

00:22:39.943 --> 00:22:42.571
I waited in
an agony of suspense

00:22:42.696 --> 00:22:45.574
until the female searcher
came back with her report.

00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:47.201
They found nothing.

00:22:47.326 --> 00:22:50.621
After that,
I have no clear recollection.

00:22:50.746 --> 00:22:54.249
I believe a police officer
drove me to Waterloo

00:22:54.374 --> 00:22:56.251
where by the merest
good fortune,

00:22:56.335 --> 00:22:58.587
I met Dr. Ferrier,
who lives near us

00:22:58.712 --> 00:23:01.465
and was traveling
down by the next train.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.509
The train you caught now
would have been?

00:23:03.592 --> 00:23:06.762
The 11:40, I think.

00:23:06.887 --> 00:23:10.390
Dr. Ferrier most kindly
took charge of me.

00:23:10.474 --> 00:23:13.435
Just as well he did,
for I had a fit in the station

00:23:13.519 --> 00:23:18.357
and before we reached home I was
practically a raving lunatic.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.567
Your brother
had already returned?

00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:22.027
Yes.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:26.073
I was surprised, but not unduly
worried that he was alone.

00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:29.952
Percy often worked late, and
I knew there was another train.

00:23:30.077 --> 00:23:32.579
So I went to bed.

00:23:32.663 --> 00:23:35.582
And sometime after midnight?

00:23:35.666 --> 00:23:39.461
I was woken by the most
fearful commotion in the hall.

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:43.632
Bring him in here,
bring him in here!

00:23:43.757 --> 00:23:46.426
Oh, God...

00:23:48.053 --> 00:23:50.848
Your brother was sleeping
down here in this room?

00:23:50.973 --> 00:23:51.682
Yes.

00:23:51.807 --> 00:23:54.309
My family were taking advantage
of their trip to America

00:23:54.434 --> 00:23:56.812
to have several of the upstairs
bedrooms redecorated.

00:23:56.895 --> 00:23:59.815
It was evident that poor Percy
was in for a long illness.

00:23:59.898 --> 00:24:02.276
So, Joseph
was bundled up to my room,

00:24:02.359 --> 00:24:08.740
and this was turned
into a sick room for me.

00:24:15.539 --> 00:24:20.294
Why, it's a very cheery room.

00:24:20.419 --> 00:24:23.672
I have lain here
for nine weeks, delirious.

00:24:23.797 --> 00:24:26.550
If it had not been for Miss
Harrison and the doctor's care,

00:24:26.675 --> 00:24:29.761
I should not
be speaking to you now.

00:24:29.845 --> 00:24:32.055
She nursed me by day,

00:24:32.181 --> 00:24:35.601
a hired nurse
looked after me at night,

00:24:35.726 --> 00:24:39.479
for in the mad fits
I was capable of anything.

00:24:39.563 --> 00:24:40.647
It's only in
the last few days

00:24:40.772 --> 00:24:45.652
that my reason
has slowly cleared.

00:24:45.736 --> 00:24:47.863
I've wired Inspector Forbes,

00:24:47.988 --> 00:24:51.366
but he's told me
no clue has been discovered.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:56.914
So I turn to you, Mr. Holmes,
as my last hope.

00:24:58.874 --> 00:25:01.877
Just one question of the utmost
importance, Mr. Phelps.

00:25:02.002 --> 00:25:05.923
Did you tell anyone that you had
this special task to perform?

00:25:06.048 --> 00:25:07.007
No one.

00:25:07.132 --> 00:25:09.551
Not Miss Harrison,
for example?

00:25:09.635 --> 00:25:11.261
No.

00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:13.305
I had not been
back to Woking

00:25:13.388 --> 00:25:19.019
in between getting the order
and executing the commission.

00:25:22.773 --> 00:25:27.611
What a lovely thing a rose is.

00:25:27.736 --> 00:25:32.741
There is nothing in which
deduction is so necessary

00:25:32.866 --> 00:25:35.369
as in religion.

00:25:35.494 --> 00:25:39.748
It can be built up as an exact
science by the reasoner.

00:25:39.873 --> 00:25:42.709
Our highest assurance of
the goodness of Providence

00:25:42.793 --> 00:25:45.754
seems to me
to rest in the flowers.

00:25:45.879 --> 00:25:49.299
It is only goodness
which gives extras,

00:25:49.424 --> 00:25:51.969
and so I say again,

00:25:52.094 --> 00:25:58.559
we have much to hope for
from the flowers.

00:26:02.729 --> 00:26:03.814
Do you see any prospect

00:26:03.939 --> 00:26:10.612
of solving this mystery,
Mr. Holmes?

00:26:10.737 --> 00:26:12.614
Mystery?

00:26:12.698 --> 00:26:17.244
Ah, it would be
absurd to deny

00:26:17.369 --> 00:26:19.913
that the case is
abstruse and complicated.

00:26:19.997 --> 00:26:21.582
Do you see any clue?

00:26:21.665 --> 00:26:22.749
You have furnished me
with seven,

00:26:22.833 --> 00:26:24.376
but I must put them
to the test

00:26:24.459 --> 00:26:27.087
before I can pronounce
on their value.

00:26:27.212 --> 00:26:28.672
You suspect someone?

00:26:28.797 --> 00:26:32.301
I suspect...

00:26:32.426 --> 00:26:33.510
myself.

00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:34.761
What?

00:26:34.845 --> 00:26:38.348
Of coming to conclusions
too rapidly.

00:26:38.473 --> 00:26:44.813
Then go back to London
and test your conclusions!

00:26:44.938 --> 00:26:50.777
Your advice is very excellent,
Miss Harrison.

00:26:54.406 --> 00:26:58.619
Mr. Phelps, do not indulge
yourself in false hopes,

00:26:58.744 --> 00:27:01.163
the affair is
a very tangled one,

00:27:01.246 --> 00:27:05.459
and I am not a magician.

00:27:08.962 --> 00:27:13.634
Hey, little varmint!

00:27:13.759 --> 00:27:16.011
What do you think
of Miss Harrison?

00:27:16.136 --> 00:27:19.014
A good sort,
or I'm mistaken.

00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:20.974
I thought you were
rather terse with her.

00:27:21.058 --> 00:27:22.476
Was I?

00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:24.311
She was only
protecting her loved one.

00:27:24.436 --> 00:27:27.272
A little
overprotective, perhaps.

00:27:27.356 --> 00:27:28.148
Surely, you don't believe

00:27:28.232 --> 00:27:31.485
that she had anything
to do with it?

00:27:31.568 --> 00:27:34.363
The most difficult crime
to track down, Watson,

00:27:34.488 --> 00:27:35.697
is the one which
is purposeless.

00:27:35.823 --> 00:27:38.242
Now, this is
not purposeless,

00:27:38.367 --> 00:27:40.994
but who is it
that profits by it?

00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:43.997
Well, there's the French
Ambassador, the Russian,

00:27:44.081 --> 00:27:46.041
and whoever might sell it
to either of those.

00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:48.877
And Lord Holdhurst.

00:27:49.002 --> 00:27:50.295
While it is not inconceivable

00:27:50.379 --> 00:27:52.548
that a statesman might
find himself in a position

00:27:52.673 --> 00:27:54.091
where he was not sorry

00:27:54.216 --> 00:27:57.177
to see such a document
accidentally destroyed.

00:27:57.261 --> 00:27:58.095
Not a statesman

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.306
with the honorable record
of Lord Holdhurst.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:06.728
George, the Foreign Office,

00:28:06.854 --> 00:28:10.065
Charles Street entrance.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.192
George, I want you
to do something for me.

00:28:12.317 --> 00:28:14.486
Find the cab
which dropped a fare there

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:19.408
just after half past 9:00
on the evening of May the 23rd.

00:28:23.745 --> 00:28:27.666
Gorot, a French name.

00:28:27.749 --> 00:28:29.418
Huguenot, actually.

00:28:29.543 --> 00:28:33.046
But I'm as English in sympathy
as you are, Mr. Holmes.

00:28:33.172 --> 00:28:36.842
Am I under some sort of cloud
because of my name?

00:28:36.925 --> 00:28:39.887
Oh, no, no,
Holmes has a French grandmother.

00:28:44.558 --> 00:28:47.519
I'd make yourself scarce if you
want to avoid Inspector Forbes.

00:28:47.603 --> 00:28:50.063
We've arranged to meet him here
in five minutes.

00:28:50.147 --> 00:28:56.195
Yes, I have
been questioned by him already.

00:28:56.278 --> 00:28:59.990
I shall do as you say.

00:29:00.115 --> 00:29:01.200
Goodnight to you both.

00:29:01.283 --> 00:29:01.909
Goodnight.

00:29:01.992 --> 00:29:03.952
Goodnight.

00:29:04.077 --> 00:29:05.454
No secret doors,

00:29:05.537 --> 00:29:07.998
the windows quite
30 feet above the ground,

00:29:08.123 --> 00:29:10.959
fastened on
the inner side.

00:29:16.465 --> 00:29:21.470
The carpet prevents any
possibility of a trap door.

00:29:21.595 --> 00:29:23.388
Now, whoever rang
the bell rope

00:29:23.472 --> 00:29:27.392
must have come
right over to the desk.

00:29:27.476 --> 00:29:31.772
Why ring it?

00:29:31.897 --> 00:29:36.068
I mean, was it the thief,
out of bravado?

00:29:36.151 --> 00:29:41.073
Or was it someone with the thief
who tried to prevent the crime?

00:29:45.494 --> 00:29:48.455
Or was it--

00:29:54.002 --> 00:29:56.922
Inspector Forbes,
I believe.

00:29:57.005 --> 00:30:00.634
Mr. Holmes,
I'm a very busy man.

00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:02.970
I have other cases
besides this one.

00:30:03.053 --> 00:30:07.850
But none so vital to the
national interest, I'll wager.

00:30:07.975 --> 00:30:11.770
May I introduce my friend
and colleague, Dr. Watson?

00:30:15.023 --> 00:30:17.317
What do you
want from me, Holmes?

00:30:17.442 --> 00:30:19.528
I know about your methods.

00:30:19.653 --> 00:30:21.822
You're ready enough
to use our information,

00:30:21.905 --> 00:30:23.657
then you try and finish
the case yourself

00:30:23.782 --> 00:30:25.492
and bring discredit on us.

00:30:25.576 --> 00:30:28.662
On the contrary,
in my last 53 cases,

00:30:28.787 --> 00:30:31.039
my name has
appeared in only 4

00:30:31.165 --> 00:30:37.838
and the police have
the credit in 49.

00:30:37.921 --> 00:30:39.882
I don't blame you
for not knowing this,

00:30:40.007 --> 00:30:43.385
you are young
and inexperienced.

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.512
But if you wish
to get on in your duties

00:30:45.596 --> 00:30:48.098
you will work with me
and not against me!

00:30:48.223 --> 00:30:51.435
Now, then, what steps
have you taken?

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.313
Tangey, the commissioner,
we've cleared.

00:30:54.396 --> 00:30:57.065
He left the Guards
with a good character.

00:30:57.191 --> 00:31:00.611
His wife is a bad lot,
though, she drinks.

00:31:00.736 --> 00:31:04.198
What about the clerk, Gorot?

00:31:04.323 --> 00:31:06.450
He's been shadowed
all these nine weeks.

00:31:06.575 --> 00:31:08.327
We can show
nothing against him.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:12.581
Have you formed any theory
about how this bell rang?

00:31:12.706 --> 00:31:13.624
No.

00:31:13.749 --> 00:31:16.043
I must confess,
that beats me.

00:31:16.126 --> 00:31:18.086
It was a cool hand,
whoever it was,

00:31:18.212 --> 00:31:19.421
to go and give
the alarm like that.

00:31:19.546 --> 00:31:22.299
Yes, yes, it was
a very queer thing to do.

00:31:22.424 --> 00:31:23.592
Well, many thanks,
Inspector,

00:31:23.717 --> 00:31:25.552
and if I can put this thief
in your hands,

00:31:25.636 --> 00:31:26.887
you shall hear from me.

00:31:27.012 --> 00:31:30.015
Come along, Watson.

00:31:30.098 --> 00:31:34.186
May I ask where
you're going now?

00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:38.649
To interview Lord Holdhurst,
the Cabinet Minister

00:31:38.774 --> 00:31:42.194
and very possibly
the next Premier of England.

00:31:42.319 --> 00:31:45.280
Good evening, Inspector.

00:31:46.532 --> 00:31:47.616
I can't pretend, Mr. Holmes,

00:31:47.741 --> 00:31:50.994
that I am ignorant of
the reason for your visit,

00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:53.622
but in whose interests
are you acting, may I ask?

00:31:53.747 --> 00:31:55.582
In the part
of Mr. Percy Phelps.

00:31:55.666 --> 00:31:58.168
Ah, my unfortunate nephew.

00:31:58.293 --> 00:31:59.920
You can understand
that our kinship

00:32:00.045 --> 00:32:04.508
makes it the more impossible
for me to screen him in any way.

00:32:04.633 --> 00:32:08.512
Yes, but if the document
is found, Lord Holdhurst?

00:32:08.637 --> 00:32:14.768
That, of course,
would be different.

00:32:16.687 --> 00:32:18.355
Lord Holdhurst,
it was in this room

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.402
that you gave instructions
for the copying of the document?

00:32:23.485 --> 00:32:26.071
It was.

00:32:26.155 --> 00:32:28.365
And you mentioned it to
nobody else except your nephew,

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:30.117
you're certain of that?

00:32:30.242 --> 00:32:32.161
Absolutely.

00:32:32.244 --> 00:32:34.454
Then if nobody
else knew of it,

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:39.168
you would agree that the thief's
presence in your nephew's room

00:32:39.293 --> 00:32:40.210
was purely accidental.

00:32:40.335 --> 00:32:43.630
I mean, he saw his chance
and took it.

00:32:45.174 --> 00:32:50.888
You take me out of my province
there, Mr. Holmes.

00:32:51.763 --> 00:32:56.935
There is one other
very important point.

00:32:57.019 --> 00:32:59.313
You feared,
so I understand,

00:32:59.396 --> 00:33:00.898
that very grave results

00:33:01.023 --> 00:33:06.278
might follow from the details
of this treaty becoming known?

00:33:06.361 --> 00:33:09.990
Very grave results indeed.

00:33:10.115 --> 00:33:12.618
Have they occurred?

00:33:12.701 --> 00:33:14.453
Not yet.

00:33:14.536 --> 00:33:16.580
If the treaty had reached,
let us say,

00:33:16.705 --> 00:33:19.416
the Russian
or the French Foreign Office,

00:33:19.541 --> 00:33:21.793
you would expect
to hear of it?

00:33:21.877 --> 00:33:23.795
I certainly should.

00:33:23.879 --> 00:33:26.882
Then since
nearly ten weeks have elapsed,

00:33:27.007 --> 00:33:29.301
it is not unfair
to suppose then

00:33:29.384 --> 00:33:35.516
that the treaty for some reason
has not reached them.

00:33:35.599 --> 00:33:36.767
But Holmes,
we can hardly suppose

00:33:36.892 --> 00:33:40.187
that the thief took the treaty
in order to...

00:33:40.312 --> 00:33:45.025
frame it and hang it
on his wall.

00:33:45.108 --> 00:33:51.824
Well, perhaps he's waiting
for a better price, Watson.

00:33:51.907 --> 00:33:56.161
Or maybe he's
had a sudden illness.

00:33:56.245 --> 00:34:02.209
A brain storm,
for example?

00:34:02.292 --> 00:34:05.546
I did not say so.

00:34:05.671 --> 00:34:10.717
Lord Holdhurst, we have taken up
too much of your valuable time.

00:34:13.595 --> 00:34:17.641
Fine fellow,
heavy responsibilities.

00:34:17.766 --> 00:34:19.893
Yes, but he has a struggle
to keep up his position,

00:34:19.977 --> 00:34:24.565
and he's far from rich.

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:29.194
You noticed, of course,
that his boots had been resoled.

00:34:29.278 --> 00:34:32.197
Really?!

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:34.741
I shall do nothing more today

00:34:34.825 --> 00:34:37.578
unless I get an answer
to my cab inquiry.

00:34:37.661 --> 00:34:39.788
Ah.

00:34:46.044 --> 00:34:49.089
All right.

00:34:54.928 --> 00:34:56.513
Oh, Watson, I won't
detain you any longer

00:34:56.638 --> 00:34:59.349
from your legitimate work.

00:34:59.474 --> 00:35:00.976
But I should be
extremely obliged

00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:03.270
if you would come down
to Woking with me tomorrow,

00:35:03.353 --> 00:35:05.981
the same train
that we took today.

00:35:06.106 --> 00:35:09.860
Yes, of course.

00:35:11.487 --> 00:35:14.114
Goodnight, Holmes.

00:35:19.161 --> 00:35:25.292
No, no, tonight I shall sleep
my own sleep, and alone.

00:35:25.417 --> 00:35:26.376
But Percy.

00:35:26.502 --> 00:35:28.504
Mr. Holmes has imbued me
with fresh hope,

00:35:28.629 --> 00:35:31.507
and I feel
I'm on the mend.

00:35:31.632 --> 00:35:36.136
We have an appointment in church
in September, my love,

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.973
and I mean to keep it.

00:36:05.582 --> 00:36:07.835
He sent the nurse away.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.379
At last.

00:36:10.462 --> 00:36:13.423
He puts too much faith
in the great detective.

00:36:13.549 --> 00:36:14.716
It's you that's kept
his flame alive,

00:36:14.842 --> 00:36:16.218
not some detective.

00:36:16.343 --> 00:36:18.512
And you, brother.

00:36:18.595 --> 00:36:23.016
Without you
to support me--

00:37:33.921 --> 00:37:37.925
Could it be that I am the center
of some monstrous conspiracy,

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:41.178
and that my life is aimed at,
as well as my honor?

00:37:41.303 --> 00:37:43.597
I haven't as far as I know,
an enemy in the world!

00:37:43.722 --> 00:37:47.017
You certainly have had your
share of misfortune, old chap.

00:37:49.144 --> 00:37:50.312
I think I may have
found the spot

00:37:50.437 --> 00:37:54.483
where the fella'
scaled the wall!

00:37:57.402 --> 00:37:59.404
It's towards the road.

00:37:59.488 --> 00:38:01.114
Ah, do you think
this was done last night?

00:38:01.198 --> 00:38:02.658
It looks rather old to me.

00:38:02.741 --> 00:38:04.618
No, I fancy we shall get
no help there.

00:38:04.701 --> 00:38:10.040
Now, why did the intruder choose
the window onto the courtyard?

00:38:10.165 --> 00:38:10.916
I should have thought

00:38:10.999 --> 00:38:13.752
this side of the house
would have been easier.

00:38:13.836 --> 00:38:15.170
It's more visible
from the courtyard.

00:38:15.295 --> 00:38:17.256
Ah, yes, of course.

00:38:17.339 --> 00:38:19.633
Have you ever had an alarm
like this before?

00:38:19.716 --> 00:38:22.427
There's no plate in the house,
or anything to attract burglars?

00:38:22.511 --> 00:38:27.391
Nothing of value.

00:38:28.475 --> 00:38:29.810
Was there anything
in London?

00:38:29.893 --> 00:38:32.479
Well, we've seen
Inspector Forbes,

00:38:32.604 --> 00:38:34.773
we've seen your uncle.

00:38:34.857 --> 00:38:36.984
Holmes has set one
or two things in motion.

00:38:37.067 --> 00:38:38.735
So you've not lost heart.

00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:41.822
Oh, by no means!

00:38:41.947 --> 00:38:43.282
God bless you
for saying that.

00:38:43.365 --> 00:38:46.410
If we keep
our courage and patience,

00:38:46.535 --> 00:38:48.996
the truth must come out.

00:38:52.374 --> 00:38:53.667
Miss Harrison,

00:38:53.792 --> 00:38:56.503
you must remain in this room
for the rest of the day.

00:38:56.628 --> 00:38:57.921
It is of vital importance.

00:38:58.046 --> 00:38:59.798
Now, tonight,
when you go to bed,

00:38:59.882 --> 00:39:02.968
lock that door from the outside
and keep the key.

00:39:03.051 --> 00:39:03.635
But Percy?

00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:04.261
Tell no one!

00:39:04.386 --> 00:39:06.513
Now, quick, promise!

00:39:08.765 --> 00:39:10.767
Why are you
moping in here, honey?

00:39:10.893 --> 00:39:12.102
Come out in the sunshine.

00:39:12.227 --> 00:39:14.396
I'll be your crockie.

00:39:15.856 --> 00:39:18.066
I have a slight headache

00:39:18.192 --> 00:39:20.736
and this room is deliciously
cool and soothing,

00:39:20.861 --> 00:39:22.404
thank you, Joseph.

00:39:22.529 --> 00:39:25.991
Mr. Phelps, while we're
investigating this minor affair

00:39:26.074 --> 00:39:30.829
we must not lose sight
of our main inquiry.

00:39:30.913 --> 00:39:32.706
It would help me very much

00:39:32.831 --> 00:39:34.500
if you would come up
to London with us.

00:39:34.583 --> 00:39:36.210
Do you feel strong enough?

00:39:36.293 --> 00:39:39.630
Yes, if you really think
I can be of help.

00:39:39.755 --> 00:39:42.674
Do you want me
to stay the night?

00:39:42.758 --> 00:39:44.593
I was on the point
of proposing it.

00:39:44.718 --> 00:39:46.678
Then if my friend of the night
comes to visit me,

00:39:46.762 --> 00:39:47.971
he'll find the bird flown.

00:39:48.096 --> 00:39:49.681
But, what about Annie?

00:39:49.765 --> 00:39:51.683
Ah, Mr. Harrison
will look after her,

00:39:51.767 --> 00:39:54.603
and my friend Watson will take
care of your medical needs.

00:39:54.728 --> 00:39:57.231
Could you be ready to leave
in an hour?

00:39:57.356 --> 00:40:00.901
We are all in your hands,
Mr. Holmes.

00:40:08.575 --> 00:40:10.369
There are one or two points
I wish to clear up,

00:40:10.452 --> 00:40:14.581
and your absence, Mr. Phelps,
will rather assist me.

00:40:14.706 --> 00:40:16.542
Watson,
when you reach London

00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:18.460
drive our friend
straight to Baker Street

00:40:18.585 --> 00:40:21.797
and remain with him
until I see you again.

00:40:21.922 --> 00:40:25.175
And now, gentlemen,
I shall leave you.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.970
What about our
investigation in London?!

00:40:28.095 --> 00:40:32.099
I hope to be in London
in time for breakfast.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:37.104
He really is the most
inscrutable fellow, Watson.

00:41:01.962 --> 00:41:04.631
Oh, you're still in here.

00:41:04.756 --> 00:41:06.175
How's your headache?

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.761
A little better.

00:41:09.887 --> 00:41:14.224
The first day for nine weeks
without the invalid,

00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:17.644
and you choose
to spend it in here.

00:41:17.728 --> 00:41:20.564
Force of habit.

00:41:20.689 --> 00:41:22.608
Are you dining tonight?

00:41:22.691 --> 00:41:25.694
I'm not hungry,
and I'm enjoying my book.

00:41:25.819 --> 00:41:29.323
Mm, I understand.

00:41:29.448 --> 00:41:34.620
My poor little sister,
what a time you've had.

00:42:20.582 --> 00:42:23.126
That'll be Mr. Holmes
returning now, sir.

00:42:24.795 --> 00:42:27.756
Thank you, Horace.

00:42:36.139 --> 00:42:38.350
He looks like a beaten man.

00:42:38.433 --> 00:42:41.854
I confess you may be right.

00:42:45.858 --> 00:42:48.902
I'd hoped for so much!

00:43:01.957 --> 00:43:04.001
Holmes, you're wounded!

00:43:04.126 --> 00:43:06.253
Oh, it's only a scratch
through my own clumsiness.

00:43:06.336 --> 00:43:08.463
Good morning, Mr. Phelps,
this case of yours

00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:13.510
is certainly one of the darkest
I have ever investigated.

00:43:15.971 --> 00:43:17.890
It has been
a remarkable experience.

00:43:17.973 --> 00:43:20.934
Oh, come along, Holmes, that
bandage tells of adventures.

00:43:21.018 --> 00:43:22.603
Now, what happened?

00:43:22.686 --> 00:43:23.979
After breakfast,
my dear Watson.

00:43:24.104 --> 00:43:25.272
Remember,
I have breathed

00:43:25.355 --> 00:43:27.608
30 miles of Surrey air
this morning.

00:43:27.733 --> 00:43:30.944
There's been no answer
to my cab inquiry, I suppose?

00:43:31.028 --> 00:43:33.322
Well, one cannot score
every time.

00:43:33.447 --> 00:43:37.618
Mrs. Hudson, you have risen
to the occasion.

00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:39.286
Won't you join us,
Mr. Phelps?

00:43:39.411 --> 00:43:41.330
Now, what's in this?

00:43:41.413 --> 00:43:42.831
Curried chicken, sir.

00:43:42.915 --> 00:43:43.499
And this?

00:43:43.624 --> 00:43:45.459
Ham and eggs.

00:43:45.542 --> 00:43:47.252
Her cuisine
is a little limited,

00:43:47.336 --> 00:43:50.923
but she has as good an idea
of breakfast as any Scotswoman.

00:43:51.006 --> 00:43:53.842
Now, what will you take,
Mr. Phelps, curried fowl, eggs,

00:43:53.967 --> 00:43:55.219
or will you help yourself?

00:43:55.344 --> 00:43:56.637
Thank you.
I can eat nothing.

00:43:56.762 --> 00:43:58.764
Oh, please, try
the dish before you.

00:43:58.847 --> 00:44:00.974
Thank you, I would
really rather not.

00:44:01.099 --> 00:44:05.479
Oh, well, then, I suppose you
have no objection to helping me?

00:44:09.858 --> 00:44:12.486
Oh!

00:44:21.703 --> 00:44:23.497
It's the treaty.

00:44:25.916 --> 00:44:30.379
It's the treaty.

00:44:30.462 --> 00:44:32.047
It's the treaty.

00:44:32.172 --> 00:44:36.844
My God, it's the treaty!

00:44:36.927 --> 00:44:38.095
It's the treaty!

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:44.518
It's the treaty!

00:44:44.601 --> 00:44:47.312
Watson, brandy.

00:44:48.438 --> 00:44:49.356
Ah, there, there, there,

00:44:49.439 --> 00:44:51.900
it really was too bad of me
to spring it on you like that,

00:44:52.025 --> 00:44:52.985
but Watson here
will tell you

00:44:53.068 --> 00:44:55.988
that I never can resist
a touch of the dramatic.

00:44:56.071 --> 00:45:00.367
God bless you
for saving my honor.

00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:03.162
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

00:45:03.245 --> 00:45:09.918
Oh, thank you for
your many considerations.

00:45:10.043 --> 00:45:15.883
A Scotswoman's breakfast,
indeed, a silly bit of paper!

00:45:15.966 --> 00:45:22.347
Please, tell me how you got it,
where it was!

00:45:22.431 --> 00:45:24.057
After I left you,

00:45:24.183 --> 00:45:26.351
I settled myself into
the English countryside

00:45:26.435 --> 00:45:29.730
and spent
a charming afternoon.

00:45:29.855 --> 00:45:33.567
I remained there until dusk,

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:36.278
and then I returned
to your house.

00:45:36.403 --> 00:45:38.071
I clambered over the wall

00:45:38.155 --> 00:45:40.949
and made my way
through the undergrowth

00:45:41.074 --> 00:45:42.743
until I reached the stables,

00:45:42.868 --> 00:45:47.789
just opposite
your bedroom window.

00:45:47.873 --> 00:45:49.958
The blind in your window
had not yet been drawn,

00:45:50.083 --> 00:45:53.504
and I could see Miss Harrison
reading a book

00:45:53.629 --> 00:45:57.674
by the light from a lamp.

00:45:58.592 --> 00:46:01.929
It was about a quarter-past ten
when she closed the book,

00:46:02.012 --> 00:46:08.936
moved across the room,
carrying the lamp with her.

00:46:09.019 --> 00:46:13.065
But I felt quite sure that she
had turned the key in the lock.

00:46:13.148 --> 00:46:14.441
Key?

00:46:14.566 --> 00:46:16.193
The instructions I gave her,

00:46:16.318 --> 00:46:18.529
which she carried out
to the letter.

00:46:18.654 --> 00:46:22.282
Mr. Phelps, she is a lady
of rare character.

00:46:22.407 --> 00:46:23.492
Without her cooperation,

00:46:23.617 --> 00:46:26.954
you would not have that paper
in your hand now.

00:46:27.079 --> 00:46:29.665
It was a weary vigil,

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:32.876
but it had the sort of
excitement a sportsman feels

00:46:33.001 --> 00:46:34.795
when he lies before
the watercourse

00:46:34.878 --> 00:46:39.258
and waits for the big game.

00:46:42.511 --> 00:46:44.805
What happened,
what happened?!

00:46:45.472 --> 00:46:47.808
It was about 2:00 o'clock
in the morning,

00:46:47.891 --> 00:46:53.313
when I heard the gentle sound
of a bolt being pushed back.

00:47:35.105 --> 00:47:36.231
All right.

00:47:36.356 --> 00:47:40.027
All right, Holmes,
what you gonna do with me?

00:47:41.987 --> 00:47:44.907
I've got what I want.

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:48.368
Ow!--Run.

00:48:03.509 --> 00:48:06.553
Joseph!

00:48:06.637 --> 00:48:09.765
You let him go?!

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:12.351
I wired full particulars
to Inspector Forbes.

00:48:12.434 --> 00:48:14.436
If he's quick enough to catch
his bird, well and good.

00:48:14.561 --> 00:48:17.105
But if, as I shrewdly suspect,
he finds the nest empty,

00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:20.609
why, all the better
for the government.

00:48:20.734 --> 00:48:22.402
I fancy Lord Holdhurst,
for one,

00:48:22.528 --> 00:48:25.823
and Mr. Percy Phelps
for another,

00:48:25.948 --> 00:48:30.160
would much rather the affair
never got to a police court.

00:48:30.285 --> 00:48:33.747
My God, do you tell me that
during my 10 long weeks of agony

00:48:33.872 --> 00:48:39.920
the stolen papers were in the
very room with me all the time?

00:48:40.045 --> 00:48:44.716
And Joseph,
a villain and a thief!

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.262
From what I gather, he had lost
heavily dabbling in stocks,

00:48:48.387 --> 00:48:50.931
and concealed the fact
from his father,

00:48:51.056 --> 00:48:53.892
a man of strictly
conservative habits.

00:48:53.976 --> 00:48:57.312
Yes, but his own
sister's happiness,

00:48:57.437 --> 00:49:01.275
and your reputation,
your health!

00:49:01.358 --> 00:49:04.945
He knew that you
often worked late,

00:49:05.028 --> 00:49:07.447
and he was in town having dinner
with his stockbroker,

00:49:07.531 --> 00:49:09.116
as he told me.

00:49:09.199 --> 00:49:12.536
But he was free
by half past 9:00,

00:49:12.661 --> 00:49:16.748
and called by your office,
entering through the side door.

00:49:16.832 --> 00:49:19.001
Percy?

00:49:26.842 --> 00:49:28.552
Finding no one in there

00:49:28.677 --> 00:49:32.431
but the light on and work
evidently in progress,

00:49:32.514 --> 00:49:34.766
he rang the bell.

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:38.979
The instant he did so, his eye
caught the paper on the table.

00:49:39.104 --> 00:49:41.815
He knew at once that chance
had put in his way

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:46.653
a state document
of immense value,

00:49:57.956 --> 00:49:59.458
returned alone to Woking

00:49:59.583 --> 00:50:02.920
and concealed it in what he
thought was a very safe place,

00:50:03.045 --> 00:50:05.214
intending to remove it
in a day or two,

00:50:05.339 --> 00:50:06.924
and take it to
the French embassy

00:50:07.049 --> 00:50:10.052
or wherever he thought
a long price was to be had.

00:50:10.177 --> 00:50:12.387
There's nobody there,
there's nobody there!

00:50:15.557 --> 00:50:19.728
Then came your sudden return.

00:50:19.853 --> 00:50:23.315
Without a moment's warning
he was bundled out of his room

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.525
and from that moment on,

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:27.569
there were always at least
two of you in there,

00:50:27.694 --> 00:50:34.201
preventing him from regaining
his treasure, maddening for him.

00:50:34.326 --> 00:50:36.703
My suspicions
became certainties

00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:37.830
when the attempt to break in

00:50:37.913 --> 00:50:40.999
was made on the first night
that the hired nurse was absent,

00:50:41.083 --> 00:50:43.710
which showed
that the intruder

00:50:43.794 --> 00:50:47.256
was well accustomed
with the ways of the house.

00:50:47.381 --> 00:50:50.509
At last,
he had his chance.

00:50:50.592 --> 00:50:53.971
But you baffled him
with your wakefulness.

00:50:54.096 --> 00:50:57.850
Yes! I didn't take
my sleeping draft!

00:50:57.933 --> 00:51:00.561
But he had another chance
when you came up to London.

00:51:00.644 --> 00:51:07.025
I kept Miss Harrison in the room
all day so as to anticipate him.

00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:09.987
But if you already knew
the papers were in the room?

00:51:10.112 --> 00:51:11.864
I thought
they probably were,

00:51:11.947 --> 00:51:14.074
but I had no desire to rip up
all the skirting

00:51:14.158 --> 00:51:15.576
in search of them.

00:51:15.659 --> 00:51:17.494
By allowing him to lead me
to the hiding place,

00:51:17.619 --> 00:51:20.122
I saved myself
an infinity of trouble.

00:51:20.247 --> 00:51:23.292
And caught him red-handed!

00:51:23.417 --> 00:51:24.835
Quite so.

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.628
Yes, but why did
he try the window

00:51:26.753 --> 00:51:28.547
when he might have come in
through the door?

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:30.924
To appear to be a burglar,
and if necessary,

00:51:31.008 --> 00:51:34.511
make good his escape
across the courtyard.

00:51:34.636 --> 00:51:36.263
The knife,

00:51:36.388 --> 00:51:40.559
you don't think he had
any murderous intentions?

00:51:40.642 --> 00:51:41.435
My dear fellow,

00:51:41.518 --> 00:51:44.313
I can only say that Mr. Joseph
Harrison is a gentleman

00:51:44.438 --> 00:51:48.942
to whose mercy I should be
extremely unwilling to trust.

00:51:49.067 --> 00:51:52.488
That will be a young lady
for you, Mr. Phelps.

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.366
Annie!

00:51:56.492 --> 00:52:00.162
I left her a note to come
to London the moment she woke.

00:52:00.287 --> 00:52:01.872
But Mr. Phelps,

00:52:01.997 --> 00:52:07.336
she knows nothing as yet
of her brother's criminality.

00:52:07.461 --> 00:52:10.422
Oh, yes.

00:52:10.506 --> 00:52:16.261
My dear Holmes,
I can't thank you enough.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:23.810
I shall go down at once
and explain everything.

00:52:25.312 --> 00:52:32.110
Percy, good-bye,
and good luck!

00:52:34.947 --> 00:52:38.492
Thank you for
restoring my happiness.

00:52:40.953 --> 00:52:44.665
There's a young lady
at the door, sir.

00:52:44.748 --> 00:52:49.086
Mr. Holmes, hot water!

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:52.714
Thank you.
